 # MyReads Project
===============================
* A bookshelf app that allows user to select and categorize books as you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.
* Project created as part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.

 
 
## To get started developing right away:
* git clone https://github.com/Cetoute/my-reads-project.git
* cd my-reads-project
* install all project dependencies with npm install
* start the development server with npm start


# Important
* The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md. That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App
* This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. You can find more information on how to perform common tasks here.

## Contributing
* This repository is the starter code for all Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

* For details, check out CONTRIBUTING.md.
